# zerodha_login

A modular approach for an automated login to zerodha for multiple users as same time.

In order to run the module, pull the repo and install pre-requisites. Once done, undate the config file with necessary details and run the code.

The code will generate respective users' auth code in individual text files. I have given feature to save auth code in to firebase. However this is upto the user to use it.
